          <p>For our final project for Human Computer Interaction, my team members and
            designed Elate, a website to help people keep track of the positive
            aspects of their lives through journals and goals. We were able to user test
            on a weekly basis, which helped us quickly respond to feedback and easily
            incorporate our new ideas. Since the class focused UX (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) we
            implemented no backend, but we found that testers enjoyed our simple and visually
            pleasing design. The site is live on GitHub, and you can check it out at the link above
            (use the username "buymepants" and the password "password2" to log in).</p>

          <p>This final project was my first experience with game design, and I had a ton of
            fun re-creating one of my childhood favorites. The goal was to re-create the video
            game of our choice, following a list of functional requirements that we determined
            as those most essential to the user experience. It was a great way to have fun
            while also developing my object-oriented programming skills.</p>

    <h1>Personal Info</h1>
      <p> I've always loved problem solving, and I found
        that programming was the perfect way to blend my creativity with something
        that challenged me. I've delved into several areas of CS through my classwork at Northwestern,
        including Front-End Design, Machine Learning, and Game Design. Outside of class
        I've enjoyed experimenting with APIs, especially those that have data
        about some of my hobbies (including playing cards, the NBA, and the
        sci-fi TV show Rick and Morty).</p>
    <h2> Programming Languages </h2>
      <p>Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, C++, C#, MATLAB, AMPL</p>
