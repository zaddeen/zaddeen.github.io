        <h3> Javascript (React) </h3>
        <p> While working remotely over the summer, I became totally transfixed with videos
          of sorting algorithms in action. Thinking about it, I realized that I was familiar with
          all of the pseudocode for the algorithms, so I decided to make my own project! I
          created this React App my spare time in order to showcase and animate some of the most
          popular/interesting sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Quicksort, and a few others.
          The project was a great way to learn React and hone my JavaScript knowledge, and I'm excited
          to continue adding to it in the future. The link to the live version is above, and I've
          also pushed all of my code with extensive comments to a GitHub repository
          <a href="https://github.com/zaddeen/sorting_algorithms" target="_blank">right here</a>.
          Feel free to play around with it, I hope you enjoy watching as much as I do!</p>

        <h3> HTML, CSS, Javascript</h3>
          <p>For our final project for Human Computer Interaction, my team members and I
            designed Elate, a website to help people keep track of the positive
            aspects of their lives through journals and goals. We were able to user test
            on a weekly basis, which helped us quickly respond to feedback and easily
            incorporate our new ideas. Since the class focused UX (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) we
            implemented no backend, but we found that testers enjoyed our simple and visually
            pleasing design. You can check out the live prototype at the link above
            (use the username "buymepants" and the password "password2" to log in)
            as well as the GitHub repository

          <p>This final project was my first experience with game design, and I had a ton of
            fun re-creating one of my childhood favorites. The goal was to re-create the video
            game of our choice, following a list of functional requirements that we determined
            as those most essential to the user experience. It was a great way to have fun
            while also developing my object-oriented programming skills.</p>

          <p> I've always loved problem solving, and I found
            that programming was the perfect way to blend my creativity with something
            that challenged me. I'm now pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Northwestern,
            and I've delved into several areas in CS through my classes - these include
            Front-End Design, Machine Learning, and Game Design. Outside of class I've enjoyed
            working with sorting algorithms and experimenting with APIs, especially those that
            have data about some of my hobbies (including playing cards, the NBA, and the sci-fi
            TV show Rick and Morty).</p>
