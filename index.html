          <p>For our final project for Human Computer Interaction, my team members and I
            designed Elate, a website to help people keep track of the positive
            aspects of their lives through journals and goals. We were able to user test
            on a weekly basis, which helped us quickly respond to feedback and easily
            incorporate our new ideas. Since the class focused UX (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) we
            implemented no backend, but we found that testers enjoyed our simple and visually
            pleasing design. You can check out the live prototype at the link above
            (use the username "buymepants" and the password "password2" to log in)
            as well as the GitHub repository

          <p>This final project was my first experience with game design, and I had a ton of
            fun re-creating one of my childhood favorites. The goal was to re-create the video
            game of our choice, following a list of functional requirements that we determined
            as those most essential to the user experience. It was a great way to have fun
            while also developing my object-oriented programming skills.</p>

          <p> I've always loved problem solving, and I found
            that programming was the perfect way to blend my creativity with something
            that challenged me. I've delved into several areas of CS through my classwork at Northwestern,
            including Front-End Design, Machine Learning, and Game Design. Outside of class
            I've enjoyed experimenting with APIs, especially those that have data
            about some of my hobbies (including playing cards, the NBA, and the
            sci-fi TV show Rick and Morty).</p>
