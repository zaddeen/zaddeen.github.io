    <h1> About Me </h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Zaddeen Benaissa, I'm a Computer Science student
          at Northwestern University. I've always loved problem solving, and I found
          that programming was the perfect way to blend my creativity with something
          that challenged me. I've delved into several areas of CS through my classwork,
          including Front-End Design, Machine Learning, and Game Design. Outside of class
          I've enjoyed experimenting with APIs, especially those that have data
          about some of my hobbies (including playing cards, the NBA, and the
          sci-fi TV show Rick and Morty).</p>
      <h2> Programming Languages </h2>
        <p>Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, C++, C#, MATLAB, AMPL</p>

      <h2> Elate (HTML, CSS, Javascript) </h2>
        <p>For our final project for Human Computer Interaction, my team members and
          designed Elate, a website to help people keep track of the positive
          aspects of their lives through journals and goals. We were able to user test
          on a weekly basis, which helped us quickly respond to feedback and easily
          incorporate our new ideas. Since the class focused UX (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) we
          implemented no backend, but we found that testers enjoyed our simple and visually
          pleasing design.  The site is live on GitHub, and you can check it out at the link below
          (use the username "buymepants" and the password "password2" to log in).</p>

      <h2> Galaga (C++) </h2>
        <p>This final project was my first experience with game design, and I had a ton of
          fun re-creating one of my childhood favorites. The goal was to re-create the video
          game of our choice, following a list of functional requirements that we determined
          as those most essential to the user experience. It was a great way to have fun
          while also developing my object-oriented programming skills.</p>
