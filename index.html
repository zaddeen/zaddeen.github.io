            <p> I've always loved problem solving, and I found
              that programming was the perfect way to blend my creativity with something
              that challenged me. I'm currently working at Google as a Software Engineer on the
              Google Cloud Andromeda team after finishing up my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in
              Compute Science at Northwestern at the end of 2022.
              In my free time I enjoy watching sports and playing video/card games,
              and I'm excited to start working on personal projects that reflect those interests.

          <p> I started watching the NBA in middle school, and I've been hooked ever since. So, when 
            trying to decide what data to use for an interactive visualization in D3, basketball was an
            easy choice. I created this visualization along with 4 other developers to show how the 3-point
            shot has revolutionized the NBA over the last 15 years, particularly since the arrival of Stephen
            Curry. We created three interactive and animated sections with the goal of highlighting the power
            of the 3-pointer at the player and team levels and showing our audience just how important the
            shot is in today's game. This was one of my favorite projects I've worked on so far, so check 
            out the visualization by clicking on the title or the photo of Steph. Remember to use the 
            buttons/menus in each section to get the interactive experience, and enjoy!

            project for our Game Development Studio class. I had a ton of fun combining my personal love of
            video games with my computer science education, and it was great sharpening up my Unity skills as well.
            In addition to the code that I wrote I put my creative side to the test and designed all of the

          <p> As COVID-19 vaccines became more and more available during the Spring of 2021, my friends and I at Homebase
            wanted to do our part to help our fellow Northwestern students and Evanston residents find appointments as
            painlessly
            as possible. To do this we created Evanston Vaccine Alert, a free service that users could sign up for to receive
            automatic
            emails with potential appointments in the Evanston & Chicago area. Optionally, we also offered the ability to
            receive
            text message updates instead. The project was a great way to give back to the community while also learning about
            the automation
            tools provided by services like AWS and SignalWire. Though the service is no longer active, you can still click on
            the logo
            to see the web page we created and learn more about the services we offered.

            of queries, and a React page to allow users to search and view results. Click on the title to watch

            all of the pseudocode for the algorithms, so I decided to make my own project! I
            created this React App my spare time in order to showcase and animate some of the most
            popular/interesting sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Quicksort, and a few others.
            The project was a great way to learn React and hone my JavaScript knowledge, and I'm excited

          <h2> Software Engineering Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="company_name"> Google </h3>
          <p> This summer I had the opportunity to join Google as a Software Engineering Intern,
              and I couldn't have had a better time. My project was to write a dashboard application to
              centralize data about machine learning models for my team, App Ads. I was tasked with writing
              both the frontend and backend, based off of some existing code that had been written by my
              two hosts earlier in the year. I started by converting the existing backend structure from
              Golang into Python, adding significant functionality and eventually creating an HTTP server 
              capable of automatically parsing data from thousands of internal files, storing that data in
              a globally distributed database, and serving the data through several API endpoints. I then 
              created an Angular app to handle the frontend, which allowed users to view model data in two ways:
              a table, which listed the name of each model and linked to its internal location, and a D3.js tree,
              which displayed any models branched from the current production models and a wealth of data about
              each of them (including their most recent file changes, if any children were being live tested
              internally, and more). In just 12 weeks I was able to complete the entire dashboard and host it
              on an internal job scheduling framework so that it could run on its own, making this one of my quickest
              and most rewarding experiences yet. </p>

            Whether it was writing custom Python functions to interact with our database, re-styling pages based on mockups
            using HTML and CSS, or even creating our own automatic email service in TypeScript, I got real experience
            with a ton of different programming languages and fields that other opportunities just couldn't offer. Though we
